John and Robert are both serious ill.
They shared the same hospital room
John's bed was next in the room's only window.
He can sit up in the bed to help drain the water from his lungs.
Robert had to spend all his time lying flat on his back.
The man did not have much to do, so they chatted for hours on end
about everything including their familily, their professions and their military service.
