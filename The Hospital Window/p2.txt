Every afternoon, when John was sitting up, he told Robert about the things outside the window.
The windows overlooked a park with a lovely lake.
There are ducks swimming on the water and a group of children sailing their toy boats.
Young couples scroll arm in arm among the trees and flowers.
Mountain can be seen in the distance.
With John's description, Robert can image the greatest view before he was putting to the hospital.
Although John's health was worsing, but he never stop sharing the wonderful view with his roomate.
