A: Hi Jerry, how is going on today?
B: There was a fire flase alarm in my community before.
Becasue someone cooks somethings and he didn't open the ventilator.
(Because someone cooks things without opening the ventilator.)
A lot of smoke was generated so that the alarm was triggered.

A: Can we reschedule the class at eight clock tomorrow night?
B: I think I can't because I need to work from 9:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the evening.
And then I need to take care of my son after work.
I only can do my own things after my son fall asleep.

A: How about 10 o'clock at Saturday night, Do you have anything to do tomorrow?
Do you have to go to work.

Okay, no problem, so I will meet you tomorrow at 10:30.
Because every Saturday at 10:00 I don't have any class, I close the schedule.
But for you, I am going to open it because we're not going to have a class tonight.
So how about this Jerry? If we continue the class tomorrow, is it ok with you.
I will type here.
Have a wonderful night, sleep well and you can do anything you want to do. 
Maybe you can watch some youtubes.
