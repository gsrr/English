Q: How are you today?
Ans:
As usual.
But I am a little nervous because my wife is going to give birth at next Tuesday.
(my second kid will be born in the next week.)
I have five days of paternity leave for this moment and I hope that everything will be going fine in the next week..




For part A, there are two questions.
1. What helps when trying to move ahead in your career?
Ans:
For this question, I need to think about two factors, one is personal factors and another is workplace factors.
But what is personal factors?
ambition, motivation, ...?
企圖心--> ambition
動機--> motivation
I think that motivation is the most important of all.
Other factors depend on it.
For my understanding, motivation is about who you want to be, what you want to get, or the goal what you want to achieve.
So if I am a student, and I want to get the first place in the school.
then I will study hard and concentrate on my study in order to get the first place.
To me, I hope to have a life security in the future.
That means that I don't want to worry about money, worry about my job, and worry about materials.
So I need to improve my ability including English speaking and professional knowledge about computer science..
(So I need to improve my ability which includes English speaking and programming.)
Because I believe that strong ability is good for making more money.
