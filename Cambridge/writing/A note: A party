Hi Leyla,
Thank you for your invitation, it s a pity that I couldn't go to your birthday party because I was in Japan on business yesterday.
But I have looked at the photos of your party on the Internet,
and it seems to that all is well and you're very happy.
I also see many friends that I don't meet for a long time on photos.
Are there anything interesting that you can share with me in your party?
Did you receive the gift that I sent you?
This thing is recommaned by many people that I meet here so I bought it immediately when I found it as the store in Japan can off an attractive prices for me due to weak currency, and I can't wait for you to play the boardgame together.
There are many things I want to know about your party.
I will go home next Saturday, inviting several friends to my house and sharing many interesting things that I see in Japan.
Do you want to come to my houst together?
