Home is a house, it is like a lot of houses but with one big difference,
it's the place where I have everything and everyone that means the most.
That is an apartment that I rent and there are three rooms, one is master bedroom including a bathroom, 
and the other are used to study or play with my children.
There is a kitchen with many kitchenware and a living room with a lot of toys threw by my boy.
I often work in the living room with my computer as it's bright and spacious at midnight because I need to take care of my children at first.
Home is also a place that I can take a rest during off-hours,
chatting and playing with my family.
I have been married about 5 years and my wife is five-month pregnant with second child, 
and I hope everything will be find.
