Hi Billal,
Hope all is well, it is a pity that you cannot go on a trip with us, we are already in Germany now.
We rent a house comes with a full kitchen and there is a supermarket close to.
Besides, there is a local store that sells goods from our home country.
And we decide to cook dinner by ourselves as we eventually find that cooking at home is much cheaper and more convenient than eating out.
Once everything is fine , we begin to visit the church and castle in this small town.
There is no ads down  the street and no commercials on TV .
In Tawian, most advertisers use a variety of tricks and techniques to influence us and that make me uncomfortable.
It really a fascinating experience.
I find  that go on a trip in a foreign country can make me relax, can forget things that happened in Taiwan, and that is why I like trip so much.
