The supermarket is a very treacherous environment if you're trying to eat well and eat healthy.
It's a sophiscated landscope, that's(that has) been designed to extract as many dollars from your wallet as possible.
Everything from the music, the number of beats in the music you hear,
to the location of products on the shelves, to the layout of whole things, is designed to get you to buy as much as possible.
So, for example, the milk will always be the maximum number of paces from the door.

The reason is that most people wanna go get a quart of milk, and they want them to pass as many other things on the way as possible.
So the path to the milk will have many, many temptations along it.
The height of the supermarket, the eye level, is the most profitable items, the highest markup.
The lower profitable items that might be better for you are at bottom.
So you'll see the highly processed cereal up here, and the oatmeal, the less processed, less profitable, down here.

In general, the supermarket is laid out so the "whole foods" are on the primeter.
By "whole foods", I mean unprocessed, real food, whether it's product, milk, fish, meat.
And in the middle is the most profitable, highly processed, junk food.
So one way to navigate the food market, if you've cancerned about your health, and you're trying to avoid eating a lot of junk, is try to shop along the edges.
And try not go into the middle, or go into the middle as little as possible , you'll do a lot better.
