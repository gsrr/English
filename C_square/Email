The golden rule for the Internet of today, if you wouldn't want it read aloud on television, think twice about including it in an email.
And be aware of how your tone might change your message.
Am I being succinct, or curt?
Is my criticism constructive, or just rude.
Include a genuine compliment if you have doubts.
If you do give criticism, ask yourself if it would be better to discuss it in person.
Shorthand is one thing, but misspellings and grammar mistakes have the tendency to speak louder than your intent message.
(speak louder than your intented message.)
Sign-off mistakes to steer clear of include things like elaborate quotations, corporate logos, they won't load identically on every platform anyway,
and extensive signature lines.
Keep it short: name, title, company, and phone.

Subject lines should catch your attention, be specific and clear, without being over the top or misleading.
Be sure you're addressing the right person specifically, for example, "Hi Jamie, Hope all is well" or "Good afternoon, Sarah."
Most profressionals receive a deluge of emails every day.
Make you email the one that they don't regret opening, and cut right off chase.
(Make your message the one that they don't regret opening, cut right to the chase.)
Be upfront with your message, whether it's a call of action, a request, question, or feedback, especially when you want to communicate the response time.
(especially when you want to communicate the desired response time.)
The Internet is for business 24 hours a day, but save your business emails for business hours, even if a spiration does strike at 3 a.m.
You don't want your email to get lost during off-hours.
(You don't want your message to get lost during off-hours.)
