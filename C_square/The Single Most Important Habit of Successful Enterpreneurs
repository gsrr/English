Many of the smartest, most successful and influential people judge who they want to buy with or not to buy with, do business with or not do business with, help or not help, trust or distrust that is based on the respect their time is given.
Not only do they have such a system, most successful people make a point of having instant reject criteria to save time in determining who they want to deal with, and who they don't.
Punctuality is so important that the only two good reasons for being late for a meeting are : one, you're dead. or two, you want to be.
Borrow from Dale Carnegie : "If you want to win friends and influence people, be punctual."


A person reveals great deal about himself by punctuality or lack of punctuality.
If you are not a punctual person, others you wish to positively influence likely negatively judge you.
It's not reasonably to have others treat your time with respect if you show little of no respect for theirs.
(You can not resonably hope to have others treat your time ...)
Being punctual gives you the right to expect and demand that others treat your time with utmost respect.
The punctual person gains advantage over staff, associates, verdors, clients, everyone who cannot keep appointments on time, cannot keep scheduled commitments, or cannot stick to a schedule.

The Single Most Important Habit of Successful Enterpreneurs.
The single most important habit of successful enterpreneurs, and people in general,
is the habit and dedication to punctuality.
Is it possible that simply being where you are supposed to be when you're supposed to be there, as promised,
without exception, without excuse, every time, all the time,
is so powerful it literally determines success and failure.
