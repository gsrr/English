Today, we are going to talk about what to watch out for when renting house in a foreign country.
If you are a student planning on studying aborad, finding a place to live is one of the first things you will need to do.
Although some schools offer domotory , most students choose their own accomendation due to increasing cost in school hosing.
Therefore, I will share with you a few tips.
First, let's look at budget.
If you are on a loosely budget, renting your own flat is probably the best option.
While those on a tighter budget, can consider looking for shared housing.


Shared housing is cheaper, but requires you to live with other housemates.
Once you decide on a budget, we can move on to the next step. 
Research your neighborhood.
Is the unit close to any bus stops or major subway lines?
How long would the commute be from your place to school.
Living close to the campus can cost more but saves your precious time and commuting expanses in the end.
So, it's important to take these things into accout when deciding on a budget, and find a balance.

Next, when living on your own, you will eventully find that cooking at home is much cheaper and more convenient than eating out.
Therefore, it's best to make sure that your unit comes with a full kitchen and that there is a supermarket close to where you live, or even better, a local store sell goods from your home country.
As an international student living away from home,
these places can be helpful whenever you are feeling a bit homesick.
Also, don't forget about safety.
Living away from home in a foreign country can be a bit scary and danguous at times.
