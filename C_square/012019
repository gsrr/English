Number three : Compensation.
Number three here should come as no surprise.
After all, most of us aren't waking up extra early, commuting, and spending all day in the office out of charity.
And while sixty percent say this is a vital part to their satisfaction, only 58 percent say they're happy with their compensation.

Ofcourse, what good is compensation if you don't know how long you'll be employed in the fitst place.
Job security was rated as number one factor to employee satisfaction in the five previous studies since 2002, so its relegation to number two is actually an optimism in the job market.
