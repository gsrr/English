- video chat, 視訊
- voice call, 語音通話

If packets are dropped, you may be disconnected, the voice may be garbled, the video may be jittery; there may be a delay or an echo.
- garbled, 混淆的
- jittery, 跳動

The experience is incredibly frustrating.

And this is even more of a challenge when speed matters, like with fast-paced stock trading or onlin video gaming, as well as with new applications like real-time health monitoring.

- matters, (vi)有關係
-- All these things do not matter now.
-- This is even more of a challenge when speed matters.

like with, 像是(伴隨著...)

as well as, 和
-- I brought a new smartphone,  as well as a new case.

just in the right order, the applications won't work properly.
