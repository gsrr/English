The numbers we can see every business day, they can tell us important information about our econmey.
But where do they come from and what do they mean?
This is a stock market in plain English.
Let's get started by talking about companies.
There are two basic types.
The first is called private company. 
Ownership of these companies are private, which means it's not available to everyone.
They're usually "small- to medium-sized", there are a lot of them, from the bekery down the street to the local trucking company.
The private companies are typically owned by an individual or a small group of people.
Because ownership is limited, we won't worry about them.

Our forcus in on the companies that offer ownership to everyone.
These are called public companies.
Here's how they work.
Let's say Zipper Corp is a successful company that has big plans.
It wants to expand and build a button factory but it doesn't have enough money.
Because it's a public company, it can divide part of ownership of company into thousands of pieces, and sell them to people like Maya.
These are companiess' stock, also called shares.
Maya gets to own a part of the company, and Zipper Corp raise money for their new factory.

Being a public company, allow Zipper Corp to raise money from lots of new owners like Maya.
Now, Maya's share of the company have a value that typically changes each business day.
When Zipper Corp is doing well, the future of company can look promising.
This means the value of the company and the value of her shares, may go up.
People like Maya buy shares because they can make money by selling them at a right time.
The big ideal is to buy shares at a lower price, and sell them at a higher price.
Of course, this is risky, because the company's future is hard to predict.
