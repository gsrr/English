The numbers we can see every business day, they can tell us important information about our econmey.
But where do they come from and what do they mean?
This is a stock market in plain English.
Let's get started by talking about companies.
There are two basic types.
The first is called private company. 
Ownership of these companies are private, which means it's not available to everyone.
They're usually "small- to medium-sized", there are a lot of them, from the bekery down the street to the local trucking company.
The private companies are typically owned by an individual or a small group of people.
Because ownership is limited, we won't worry about them.
