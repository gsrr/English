我今天需要跟我太太去醫院看小孩, 但因為今天是上班日, 所以交通很阻塞.
I went to the hospital to see my daughter with my wife today.
But the traffic is congested because today is working day.

這個禮拜是清明節, 以前都會回家掃墓, 但今年可能就沒辦法了.
因為我們必須留在台北照顧小孩.
This Thursday is Tomb Sweeping day.
I went to my parent's home and sweeped the tome before.
But I think that I can't do that this year because I need to take care of my children.
