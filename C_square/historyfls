At face value, it's an internet site that allows friends and colleagues to stay in touch.
But in business terms, Facebook is so much more.
The social networking site has more than 900 million users, and last year it generated revenue of 3.7 billion dollars.
Most of that comes from advertising.
However, its online advertising business has slowed recently, which worries some investors, while the company is struggling to make money from its fastest-growing sector -- those users who access the site from mobile devices.
And General Motors has announced that it's planning to stop advertising on  Facebook because it can't see the value for money.
Yet the company has still proved irresistible to many investors.
