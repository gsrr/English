What? What do you mean?
You've lost the DollarMart contract?
On common, tell me you are joking.
This our biggest contract and you've lost it.
Yes, I know you've had some personal problem recently.
Yes, I know our competitors have improved their offer.
But, really, Brian, These are just excuses.

You failed to meet agreed targets for the entired last quarter.
We talked about this at your last performance review,
and I told you then it had to improve.
(and then I told you it had to improve)
and in the quiet honest, it hasn't.
Losing DollarMart contract is the last straw, that's your last chance.
(the final straw)
I'm going to have to let you go.
Yes, let you go, that's what it means, you are fired.
