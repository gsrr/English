What do you mean?
You lost the DollarMart contract?
Oh, Brian, tell me you're joking.
That is our biggest contract and you've lost it.
Yes, I know you've had some personal problem recently.
Yes, I know our competitors have improved their offer.
But, really, Brian, these are just excuses.

You failed to meet agreed target through the entire last quarter.
We talked about this at your last performance review and I told you then that had to improve.
and to be quiet honest, it hasn't.
Losing the DollarMart contract is the last straw.
I am sorry, Brian, that's your last chance.
I am going to have to let you go.
Let you go, yes, that what it means, you are fired.

Hi Jess, can you put me through to Marcia in HR, please.
Hi Marcia, it is Philip, Listen, I have to let Brian go.
He lost us the DollarMart account.
Yes, I know, but it had been going on for a while.
He just wasn't pulling his weight anymore.
He'd been warned, his last performance review is really bad, he knew it was coming.
So we'll be looking for someone new,and we'll need to decide on who that is.
