They have to be a team player, Brian never was.
So strong interpersonal skills.
And I want someone with vision, vision, I know it's difficult to define.
But what I mean is : Someone who knows we are in a rapidly changing market, and he can use it to our advantage.
Experience with online sales? Perhaps...but yes, I would be interested in that.

Who are we looking for?
Good question, I was hoping that you might be able to help me with that.
Here's what I'm thinking, let me know if you agree.
Obviously, they need to have a first degree, doesn't matter what subject, then masters or an MBA, I would say.
Experience? At least five years relevant experience in an international company.
And I want someone with a proven track record.

So Marica, how many applications did we get?
(So how many applications did we get, Marcia?)
Overall, we get over two hundreds.
(Well, overall we've got over two hundred)
That many?
Yes, but most of which we can discard right away, people who do not have right experience or qualification, that kind of things.
(people who do not have right experience, qualifications that kind of thing...)
And we also receive CVs with ten pages long, and cv in comicbook font.
(And then we get the people who submits ten-pages long CVs, or CVs in comicbook font, you know the kind of thing.)
So I whittled down serious candicates to a short list of twelve people.

Language skill, I can't emphasize that enough, not necessary a native speaker, but they must be very good at English.
(I can't emphasise that enough, )
And another language as well, Spanish, Mardian is best.
Great, can you put the ad on the website as soon as possible, and trade press as well.

Hi Jass, could you put me through to Marica in HR, please.
Hi Marica, this is Philip here.
Listen, I have to let Brian go, he lost us the DollarMart account.
It had been going on for a while, he just wasn't pulling his weight anymore.
He'd been warned, his last performance review was really bad, he knew it was coming.
So we'll be looking for someone new, and we need to decide who that is.
(and we'll need to decide who that is)
