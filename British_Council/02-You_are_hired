They have to be a teamplayer, Brian never was.
So strong interpersonal skills.
And I want someone with vision.
Yes, vision, I know it's difficult to define.
What I mean is someone who knows we are in a rapidly changing market and they can use it to our advantage.
Experience with online sales? Perhaps...but yes, I would be interesting in that.
(I would be interested in that)

Who are we looking for?
Good question! I was hoping that you might be able to help me with that.
Here's what I'm thinking, let me know if you agree.
Obviously, they need to have a first degree, doesn't matter what subject.
Then masters or an MBA, I would say.
Experience? at least five years experience in an international company.
And I want someone with a proven track record.

Hi Jass, could you put me through to Marica in HR, please.
Hi Marica, this is Philip here.
Listen, I have to let Brian go, he lost us the DollarMart account.
It had been going on for a while, he just wasn't pulling his weight anymore.
He'd been warned, his last performance review was really bad, he knew it was coming.
So we'll be looking for someone new, and we need to decide who that is.
(and we'll need to decide who that is)
