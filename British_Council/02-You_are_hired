Do we need to interview all of them?
(And we'll interview all of them?)
I think we should be, but I will let you have a look first.
(I think we should, but obviously I'll let you have a look first.)
What kind of people do we get?
(Great, so who have we got then?)
We get some strong applications, two in particular.
(Well, I think we've got some pretty strong candidates, two in particular.)
They have the right kind of profile?
I would say yes, strong educational background, language skill, multinational sales,...
(I would certainly say so -- a strong educational background, experience in multinatinoal sales, language skills...)
I look forward to meet them.
(Good, I look forward to meeting them)
look forward to 是片語動詞, 所以這三個字就代表一個動詞, 後面要接名詞(受詞), 所以要用動名詞--> meeting
I would say we do the standard interview format.
(So I would say we do the standard interview format == So I would say the standard interview format that we do)

So how many applications did we get, Marcia?
Well, overall we have got over two hundred.
That many?
Yes, most of which we can discard right away, people who don't have right experience, qualifications that kind of thing.
And we also receive some people send 10 pages long CVs, and CVs in comicbook font , you know that kind of thing.
(And then we get the people who submit 10 pages long CVS, or CVS in comicbook font..)
So I whittled down from serious candidates to a short list of twelve people.

Language skill, I can't emphasise that enough.
Not necessary a native speaker, but they must be very good at English, and another language as well.
Spanish, Mardian is best.
Great, can you get the ad out on the website as soon as possible, and the trade press as well.
(Can you get a ad out on the website as soon as possible?)
Thanks, Marica, I want to have the new sales director by the end of the month.

They have to be a team player, Brian never was.
So strong interpersonal skills.
And I want someone with vision, vision, I know it's difficult to define.
But what I mean is : Someone who knows we are in a rapidly changing market, and he can use it to our advantage.
Experience with online sales? Perhaps...but yes, I would be interested in that.

[1]
Who are we looking for?
Good question, I was hoping that you might be able to help me with that.
Here's what I'm thinking, let me know if you agree.
Obviously, they need to have a first degree, doesn't matter what subject, then masters or an MBA, I would say.
Experience? At least five years relevant experience in an international company.
And I want someone with a proven track record.

Hi Jass, could you put me through to Marica in HR, please.
Hi Marica, this is Philip here.
Listen, I have to let Brian go, he lost us the DollarMart account.
It had been going on for a while, he just wasn't pulling his weight anymore.
He'd been warned, his last performance review was really bad, he knew it was coming.
So we'll be looking for someone new, and we need to decide who that is.
(and we'll need to decide who that is)
