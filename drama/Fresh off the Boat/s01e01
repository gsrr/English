(How much is this going to cost us?)


---------------------------------
[5]
- shoot, 拍攝
- deejaying, 擔任DJ
- bat mitzvah, 受戒禮
- margarita, 瑪格麗塔雞尾酒
- til and until, 
-- 1. 語氣不同, til與not無緣
-- I did not know his name till yesterday.
-- I did not know his name until yesterday.
-- Until yesterday, I did not know his name.
-- Not until yesterday, I knew his name.
- 文章標題、科技英文、廣告slogan，最常省略的就是只有文法作用的function word，例如be動詞或助動詞。再來是不影響閱讀或句意明顯的主詞或受詞
- 關係代名詞
-- 若關係子句中已經有主詞，而關係代名詞是作為關係子句中的受詞，且前面沒有逗號或介係詞時，關係代名詞可以省略。
--- This is the book that I read yesterday.
--- This is the book I read yesterday.
--- He is the man whom I saw at the school yesterday.
--- He is the man I saw at the school yesterday.
(其實就是省略後還可以看懂, 那就可以省略)

--- The girl sitting over there is my little sister.
--- The books that were written by J.K.Rowling are popular among teenagers.

--- 答案是: 看句子意思是哪個比較正確.
--- I have an aunt teaching English at our school.
--- I have an aunt who is teaching English at our school. 
(X, 意思略為不對, 我有一個阿姨正在我的學校教英文)
--- I have an aunt who teaches English at our school.(O, 較為合理.)
(O, 我有一個阿姨在我的學校教英文)
- feel, 聯綴動詞(linking verb)
-- 這類的動詞就是這樣，它們的後面都是接「形容詞」
-- 這一類的動詞，有時會因需要在其後面加上「介詞」like（像）
-- I feel happy.
-動詞 "look", "sound", "smell“, ”taste“, ”feel“ 經常後面緊接著介系詞 like，然後再接名詞片語，用以表示「看起來像」、「聽起來像」、「聞起來像」、「嚐起來像」、「感覺起來像」。like 是介系詞，後面的名詞片語是它的受詞。這種由 like 起頭的介系詞片語，當形容詞使用，作為主詞補語。

Mom, is there China-town in Orlando?
Hey, no more questions Barbara Walters, pick up a lamp.

This is why we leave China-town in DC, this is why we leave our family and friend.
Exactly.
This is why we leave everything we know to come to a place we know nothing and the humility is not good for my hair.
I am Okay.
And for what, your father can own his cowboy restaurant.
It's called Cattleman's Ranch steakhouse, and I can't wait for you all to see it, it's beautiful, it's big, brown, and beaufiful.
Like Shaq?
Exactly like Shaq.
Why you like Shaq so much, why you not like Pete Sampras, so sexy, all that hair.

Dad, turn off the music.
Eddie, I know you're not excited to leave DC, but you're gonna love Orlando.
I have been there for six months setting up restaurant, and I've grown to love it like a daughter we wish Evan had been.
I don't why we have to move? Why could you keep going back and forth between Orlando and DC?
Because I didn't come to American to work for your mom's brother selling furniture for the rest of my life.
Your father is right.


[1]
Was I excited about the move?
No
Did anyone ask me if I was excited?
Hell no
