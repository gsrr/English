Lot of white folks here?
Not like back in DC.
Yeh, the only way white people we saw there is the tourist got lost.
(the only way white people we ever saw there is the tourists get lost.)
White House?
Hey, you boys, you're gonna sit down or pick a box and help.
(you boys gonna just sit there or pick a box and help?)
(gonna是口語化, 等於be going to)
Mom, is there China-town in Orlando?
Hey, no more questions, Barbara Walters, pick up a lamp.
(pick up a lamp)

[4]
Your father is right.
This is why we left China-town in DC,this is why we left our family and friend.
Exactly.
This is why we left everything we know and come to a place we know nothing and the humility is not good for my hair.
I am Okay.
So your father can have his cowboy restaurant.
It's called steakhouse.
(It's called Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse.)
I can't wait for you all to see it.
It's beautiful, it's big, brown, and befautiful.
Like Shaq.
Exactly, like Shaq.
Why you like Shaq so much, Why you not like Pete Samplas.
(Pete Sampras.)
(Why not+V(原形動詞))
So sexy, all that hair.
He is OK.
Your favorite song.

Dad, turn off the music.
Eddie, I know you're not excited to leave DC, but you're gonna love Orlando.
I have been there for six months setting up a restaurant, and I've grown to love it like a daughter we wish Evan had been.
(Evan had been, 過去完成式, 在過去的那個時間點已經完成的事件.)
(The plane had already taken off when I arrived the airport.)

I don't know why we have to move.
Why couldn't you keep going on back and forth between Orlando and DC.
Because I didn't come to American to work for your mom's brother selling furniture for the rest of my life.


[2]
Was I excited about the move?
No
Did anyone ask me if I was excited?
Hell no
But it's hard getting respect when you're 11.

[1]
This is my dad, he loved everything of American.
Full-on bought into the American.
My mom was always hard on me way before the "Tiger Mom" stuff.
She thought I was trying to cause trouble wearing that nas shirt.
But she didn't understand, if you're an outsider, hit-hop will be your anthem.
And I was definitely the black sheep of my family.
Those other people are Emery, Evan, grandma, whatever.

Your father is right.
This is why we left Chinatown in DC, this is why we left our family and friends.

So your father can own a cowboy restaurant.
It's called Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse.

It is big, brown, and beautiful.
Like Shaq?
Exactly like Shaq.
Why you like Shaq so much?
Why you not like Pete Sampras?
