到公司後, 一開始會做哪些事?
(What things I do when I work at the beginning?)

[1]
我現在幾乎每天都在讀英文, 所以我在坐火車時, 也都盡量利用這些時間來讀英文.
但即便花了這麼多時間在讀, 有時還是覺得英文能力似乎沒有多大提升.
因為我還是都聽不太懂, 講也還是不太會講.
也許很多事情並不能夠一步登天, 但很多時候還是會想...
這樣做是不是正確的方向? 再繼續下去真的會有用嗎?
我想應該是會的吧, 因為其實我讀的也還不算多(30堂課),
再繼續讀下去吧, 這是我現在唯一可以做的事.

I usually go to work by "High Speed Rail", and get off work by train.
I take the MRT sometimes if I can not find the proper train number.
Although I spend a lot of time to study English, even by taking the train,
but my English ability isn't improved as much as I expected.
I still cannot understand when listening the video, and I cannot express what I think exactly by English.
I know "Rome was not built in a day", but what I don't know is that is it a right direction or is it useful to continue?
I think it should be right. My ability should be improved if I study more classes.
Just move on, this is the only thing that what I can do.

* go to work
* get off work
* take the tain
